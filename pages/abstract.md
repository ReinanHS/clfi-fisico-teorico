# Abstract

This research offers a comprehensive exploration of the field of theoretical physics, highlighting both the educational paths and activities involved in the career of a theoretical physicist. We begin by outlining the training choices available to physics students, emphasizing the distinction between undergraduate and bachelor's degrees. We then detail the required educational pathway, which includes undergraduate, master's and doctoral courses in theoretical physics.

A significant part of this research focuses on the day-to-day activities of a theoretical physicist, including research, experimentation, data analysis, publishing, and teaching. We explore how these activities intertwine to form the routine of a theoretical physicist and how autonomous research and collaboration are essential to the advancement of scientific knowledge.

In the Brazilian context, we highlight additional challenges that affect scientific research, such as funding limitations, insufficient infrastructure and changes in public policies related to science and technology. However, we highlight the dedication and passion of Brazilian theoretical physicists who continue to contribute significantly to global physics despite these obstacles.

This research concludes by emphasizing the fundamental role of theoretical physicists in the search for understanding the fundamental principles of nature. They not only unlock the mysteries of the universe, but also drive the development of innovative technologies and systems that benefit society. Theoretical physics is a fascinating and challenging discipline that transcends borders and shapes the future of scientific knowledge. Theoretical physicists are architects of knowledge, explorers of the frontiers of human understanding, and educators who inspire future generations to continue this relentless search for answers.
